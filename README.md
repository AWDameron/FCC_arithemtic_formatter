# FCC_arithemtic_formatter


This is one of the required projects for Free Code Camp (FCC) required for certifcation.

The point of the program is to accept up to 5, arithmetic equations and then display them in a top down format.

i.e.   
"  37
+ 13 
----
50 "

The link is below if you'd like to see the program itself.  If you're doing this problem on your own, i recommend trying to do it on your own and not copying mine, if you have questions though please feel free to reach out. 

I have supplied the link below for reference.
